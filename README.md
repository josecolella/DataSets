DataSets
=======


This repository hostes the python class that Iâ€™m creating to be able to write
both R and Python files that contain code that visualizes different types of charts
using ggplot2 in R and matplotlib in Python.

The visualization models include:
- Bar plot
- Box plot
- Histogram
- Stack plot
- Line Plot
- scatter plot
- pie plot
